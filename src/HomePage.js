                I am Asima Kochariyeva. It is my 3'rd year at ADA University and my faculty is Information Technologies. Moreover, I was a Teaching
                Assistant at Stanford Education Centre and I was teaching Microsoft Office Programs so at the end i got a certificate. I am a Social
                Media Manager at ADA empowHERment Club. Additionally, I am a Volunteer at ADA Volunteer Movement. In 5-12 September 2022, I was
                registering newly admitted students on portal.edu.az and ada.edu.az websites. At the end, I also took a survey about where and how did
                they get information about ADA University and which school they studied and so on from each student. I also love being active and
                managing time efficiently. I often join some projects, events, masterclass trainings and etc. For detailed explanation, you can view
                which projects I attended on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asima-kochariyeva-65b643224">my LinkedIn </a> Profile.
